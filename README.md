angularjs-initservice
=====================

Example code for the [article](http://blog-it.hypoport.de/2013/10/28/angularjs-ordered-init-async-promise/) at the [Hypoport IT blog](http://blog-it.hypoport.de/).

The code uses the JSFiddle echo service, but due to CORS it won't work out of the box.
You need to either provide a backend on your own or use the [online demo](http://jsfiddle.net/gesellix/xxKjw/).
